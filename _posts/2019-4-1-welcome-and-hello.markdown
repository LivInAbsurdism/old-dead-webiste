Ice climbing. Say it, and you conjure weird images. Images of what? Danger? Climbing in the Himalayas?
There's all sorts of reactions.

It's incredibly intimidating for how simple it is. The basis of ice climbing is built on the A frame - the basic stance
you should have the majority of the time that you are on ice. Ideally, feet shoulder width apart and arms (complete with
ice axes) closer together above your head. You kick in to move further up the wall and you either top-rope or you screw ice
axes into the wall.

So why do it? The element of risk for many people is too much, but the feeling of ice climbing and of taking your life into your own hands is intoxicating. You have autonomy.

Extend that to climbing, backcountry skiing, even sky diving, and you've suddenly unlocked a mindset for a whole group of people.
