It seems at every workplace I've worked, the word "branding" has been stamped onto my forehead and permeated into my brain. (And mine is honestly a work in-progress.)

I've been told to consider my look, my internet presence, my social media activity, and pretty much every facet of my life. As someone who dislikes doing things for the sake of convention, I'm amenable to aspects of these "branding" rules, but believe that they were ultimately meant to be bent.

So welcome to my blog - which will in time also serve as my portfolio - this is mostly a place for me to express ideas related to code, education, and tech as a whole.

At the end of every page, I'll be including a recipe I am currently enjoying. Without further adieu, I present this post's recipe:

## Roasted Salmon and Asparagus with Hollandaise

### Ingredients

* 12 oz salmon (2 fillets of similar size)
* 2 tsp dill
* 1 bunch asparagus, ends removed
* 1 tbsp avocado oil
* Salt and pepper
* 2 eggs (optional)

#### For the Hollandaise Sauce:
* 4 egg yolks
* 1 tbsp lemon juice
* 1/4 tsp salt (omit if using salted butter)
* 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper
* 1/2 cup ghee, melted
Note: the hollandaise sauce will make a larger batch than you need, but a smaller batch is only feasible if you have an immersion blender. In a regular blender, you need more liquid.


### Instructions

Preheat oven to 375 degrees and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.

Place the salmon on baking sheet and season with salt, pepper, and dill. Bake for 15-20 minutes depending on the thickness of salmon pieces.

While the salmon is cooking, prepare asparagus by cutting off the thick ends (about 1-2 inches). When the salmon has 10 minutes left to cook, take it out of the oven and add in the asparagus to the baking sheet in an even layer. Drizzle asparagus with oil and season with salt and pepper. Return pan to oven to cook for remaining 10 minutes.

After adding asparagus to the oven, prepare hollandaise sauce.

Whisk together egg yolks, lemon juice, salt, and cayenne until slightly thickened.

Place mixture in a blender or food processor. Blend while very slowly drizzling in the melted butter. Taste and add more seasonings if desired.

When the salmon and asparagus are finished, cook eggs for topping if you are having eggs. We like fried eggs over easy, but poached would be perfect for this recipe too.

Finally, plate your meal. Start with an asparagus base and top with salmon and egg. Drizzle hollandaise sauce over everything and sprinkle with a little dill. Serve and enjoy!
